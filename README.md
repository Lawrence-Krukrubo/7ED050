The module aims to develop the tutors' curiosity about the wider context in which they teach and/or support learning, and to explore challenges and opportunities that may affect their learnersâ€™ experience.

The programme for the module is dynamic as it reflects the changing nature of higher educational debate and considers a range of influencing topics, e.g., teaching excellence, policy, culture, environment, post-digital, sustainability, societal and legal issues, etc. 

To support debate and dialogical learning, you will engage with guest speakers (virtual and face-to-face), a range of stakeholders from within the University and beyond, and your peers to enable you to explore contemporary challenges and opportunities that are relevant to each particular topic.
